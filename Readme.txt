Part1

Hi there I am Arpan Arpan , I got my first assignment of MvcApplication.
I started it while doing the same steps as I followed for the tutorial.
Since in my last tutorial I commented the sslport which was a obstacle in running the application.So here I
am doing this step in advance so that I don;t get an error!!!!!!! Yes I am smart..... 
I started and It worked.

According to the assignment Instructions 
I am working on the App for the Rulers.

Part2
The step is to add a controller in the application.
I replaced the code with the given code of the tutorial...  

The main focus was to add the parameteres in the controller like numtimes.
So here i updated the welcome method to pass the parametres in it.Let's try this out in the browser.
Since i have to pass some information in the url i searched the given url:"https://localhost:{PORT}/HelloWorld/Welcome?name=Rick&numtimes=4"
Again I am doing the change in the parameters in which i am using ID.
and tried it out.It worked and now i am moving to the next part.
