Part1

Hi there I am Arpan Arpan , I got my first assignment of MvcApplication.
I started it while doing the same steps as I followed for the tutorial.
Since in my last tutorial I commented the sslport which was a obstacle in running the application.So here I
am doing this step in advance so that I don;t get an error!!!!!!! Yes I am smart..... 
I started and It worked.

According to the assignment Instructions 
I am working on the App for the Rulers.

The step is to add a controller in the application.
I replaced the code with the given code of the tutorial...
